## Code of Conduct
### Rory

I chose the Code of Conduct. I think that the contributor covenant is best for our purposes
because of it's inclusive nature. I decided to tweak it a little bit, getting rid of a temporary ban for more of a three strikes and your'e out approach, alongside allowing "trolling".

## License 
### Holden 
I chose the Apache Licesne as our projects license. This was one of the most open source/free use ones that I saw 
on the comparison table provided in the lab lesson. Rory and I both agreed that we think anything as simple as something we would do in a lab exercisse or our actual program, people should be able to use it to make thier job easier and to improve it if they wish.
